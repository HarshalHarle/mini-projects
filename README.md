# My Web Development Journey

Welcome to my web development journey repository! Here, I have documented the small projects I worked on while learning the basics of web development. Each project folder contains separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

In this repository, I have curated a collection of small web development projects that mark the beginning of my journey into the world of web development. These projects were created as part of my learning process, exploring different concepts, and applying the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Each project is contained within its own folder, accompanied by separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects cover a range of topics and showcase my progress in building static web pages and incorporating interactive elements.

Through this repository, I aim to share my growth as a web developer and provide inspiration to others who are starting their own web development journey. Feel free to explore each project folder, delve into the code, and witness my evolution as I learn and experiment with various web development techniques.

I hope you find this collection informative, insightful, and perhaps even inspiring. Happy exploring!
